# How to Play

The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list.

You have a limited number of attempts to guess the word.

Enter one letter at a time when prompted.

If your guess is correct, the letter is revealed in the word.

If your guess is incorrect, the hangman figure progresses to the next stage.

The game ends when:

You correctly guess all the letters of the word (you win!), or

You run out of attempts (you lose!).
